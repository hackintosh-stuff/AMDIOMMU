# AMDIOMMU — authoritative source repository

## Source and evidence policy

- `kext/`, `tools/` are canonical implementation and generator inputs. `include/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `fixtures/`, `reference/` contain existing modules, tests and reference inputs.
- `generated/round26/` is the historical generated Lucy inspection/reproducibility copy; do not edit it by hand.
- Runtime evidence, kext binaries, SDKs, upstream tarballs and full patch-package before/after snapshots are not committed.

Every future patch must name the full base commit and target this repository. Verify the expected working tree and use `git apply --check` before applying a patch. Never overwrite local changes or edit the baseline to force acceptance. Source identity in evidence is a Git commit hash, not a source snapshot. Logs, raw exports, binary identities and experiment results remain separate from provenance; repository commits do not constitute hardware validation.
